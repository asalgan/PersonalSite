			<h2>first</h2>
			<p>I graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 2010 with a degree in finance and economics. No thoughts of web development on the horizon.</p>
			<h2>then</h2>
			<p>I spent some time working at UBS Financial Services, but quit to co-found and launch <a href="http://www.funderhut.com" target="_blank">FunderHut</a>, a community-focused crowdfunding platform.</p>
			<h2>now</h2>
			<p>I'm just about done with <a href="http://www.starterschool.com" target="_blank">Starter School</a>, where I learned the basics of Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS/Less/Sass, JavaScript/jQuery, UI/UX, Git, etc.</p>
			<h2>after</h2>
			<p>Build awesome things.</p>

		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">GOAL</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">When I wanted to find a healthy meal near me, I was tired of having to first check what's near me, then cross-reference menu items at each place comparing nutritional information. I wanted a tool where I can simply enter where I am, the maximum number of calories I want to consume that meal, and what cuisine I'm in the mood for and have it find specific items that meet my criteria.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">CHALLENGES</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">I had to pull lots of food data from various sources and input that data into my database. I also needed the Google Maps API to cross-reference restaurant names that it found within my search radius with the restaurant names I entered into my database to pull up their nutritional nutritional information.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">SOLUTIONS</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">I found a crawler called <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/learn/intro" target="_blank">Kimono</a> that I used to crawl nutritional data from restaurant websites. I then used the <a href="https://github.com/Empact/roo" target="_blank">Roo gem</a> to pull the data from my spreadsheet and seed the database. I was able to enter approximately 30 restaurants worth of food data and then put the project on hold, realizing that gathering all of the nutritional data for the tens of thousands of restaurants out there was no easy task.</p>

		<img src="/assets/honeybee.png" alt="" class="nogylt-img col-md-12">
		<h3 class="built-with col-md-12">Ruby on Rails <span class="bars"> // </span> PostgreSQL <span class="bars"> // </span> Bootstrap/Sass</h3>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">GOAL</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">This is a problem that I had faced as a small business owner. I needed an easy, affordable way to track applicants outside of email and spreadsheets. I didn't need an expensive HR Suite, just a place to create openings, receive applicants, and sort/filter through each one. I also wanted to store all past applicants in case a new position opened up, so that I can find one that matches what I'm looking for and reach out to him/her without posting a new opening. I needed all of the applicant information to be one page, and implement one-click accept/reject for efficient filtering.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">CHALLENGES</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">When building, a challenge I faced was to avoid over-building. I had to constantly remind myself of what my goal was for this application - to create openings and track applicants. This was also my first time integrating a payment system, so that was a challenge for me as well.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">SOLUTIONS</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">I used the lessons from <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/" target="_blank">Getting Real</a>, a book by the Basecamp team about the process of building web applications and staying lean. I also changed the way I go about building a feature: Instead of first coding Ruby, then the HTML, I reversed the order to first create sketches, then create the HTML, then the Ruby. This seemed counter-intuitive for me at first, but I realized it had allowed me to spend less time making changes and more time building what I truly needed. Regarding payments, I used <a href="http://www.stripe.com" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, which offers some great documentation on how to implement it with a Rails app.</p>
