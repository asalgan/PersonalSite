			<h2>first</h2>
			<p>I graduated from Loyola University Chicago in 2010 with a degree in finance and economics. No thoughts of web development on the horizon.</p>
			<h2>then</h2>
			<p>I spent some time working at UBS Financial Services, but quit to co-found and launch <a href="http://www.funderhut.com" target="_blank">FunderHut</a>, a community-focused crowdfunding platform.</p>
			<h2>now</h2>
			<p>I'm just about done with <a href="http://www.starterschool.com" target="_blank">Starter School</a>, where I learned the basics of Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS/Less/Sass, JavaScript/jQuery, UI/UX, Git, etc.</p>
			<h2>after</h2>
			<p>??? .. build awesome things.</p>

		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">GOAL</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">When I wanted to find a healthy meal near me, I was tired of having to first check what's near me, then cross-reference menu items at each place comparing nutritional information. I wanted a tool where I can simply enter where I am, the maximum number of calories I want to consume that meal, and what cuisine I'm in the mood for and have it find specific items that meet my criteria.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">CHALLENGES</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">I had to pull lots of food data from various sources and input that data into my database. I also needed the Google Maps API to cross-reference restaurant names that it found within my search radius with the restaurant names I entered into my database to pull up their nutritional nutritional information.</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content-lead col-md-12">SOLUTIONS</p>
		<p class="my-apps-content col-md-12">I found a crawler called <a href="http://www.kimonolabs.com/learn/intro">Kimono</a> that I used to crawl nutritional data from restaurant websites. I then used the <a href="https://github.com/Empact/roo">Roo gem</a> to pull the data from my spreadsheet and seed the database. I was able to seed approximately 30 restaurants worth of food data and then stopped. I realized that gathering all of the nutritional information for the tens of thousands of restaurants out there is damn near impossible and I didn't want to spend years doing so, so I moved on to my next project.</p>
